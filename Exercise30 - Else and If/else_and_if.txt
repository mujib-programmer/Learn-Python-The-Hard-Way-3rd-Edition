Else and If
-----------

In the last exercise, you worked out some if- statements and then tried to guess what they
are and how they work. Before you learn more, I’ll explain what everything is by answering the
questions you had from the Study Drills. You did the Study Drills, right?

1. What do you think the if does to the code under it? An if- statement creates what is
called a “branch” in the code. It’s kind of like those choose-your-own-adventure books
where you are asked to turn to one page if you make one choice and another if you go
a different direction. The if- statement tells your script, “If this boolean expression is
True, then run the code under it, otherwise skip it.”

2. Why does the code under the if need to be indented four spaces? A colon at the end
of a line is how you tell Python you are going to create a new “block” of code, and then
indenting four spaces tells Python what lines of code are in that block. This is exactly the
same thing you did when you made functions in the fi rst half of the book.

3. What happens if it isn’t indented? If it isn’t indented, you will most likely create a Python
error. Python expects you to indent something after you end a line with a : (colon).

4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if- statement? Try it.
Yes, you can, and they can be as complex as you like, although really complex things
generally are bad style.

5. What happens if you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs? Because
you are comparing numbers, if you change the numbers, different if- statements will
evaluate to True, and the blocks of code under them will run. Go back and put different
numbers in and see if you can fi gure out in your head what blocks of code will run.

Compare my answers to your answers, and make sure you really understand the concept of a
“block” of code. This is important for when you do the next exercise, where you write all the parts
of if- statements that you can use.
